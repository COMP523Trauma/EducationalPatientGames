CAPTAIN SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

When you first enter the webpage you see the bar wrapper that 
is to feature different games.  Currently Captain Safety is the
only playable game.  To play Captain Safety select the Captain
Safety icon.

After this has been completed you will be taken to the Captain
Safety starting screen which features a finger super hero.  To 
start the game select "Play!" in the bottom right-hand corner of 
the screen.

You will be taken to the game level which is set in the park.
Bikers and skateboarders will start to ride on the screen, some 
wearing helmets, some not wearing helmets.  Click on the riders 
not wearing helmets to give them helmets and earn a point each time 
you do so.  If you click on a biker already wearing a helmet you 
lose a point. You are given 60 seconds to identify and give helmets 
to as many helmetless bikers and skateboarders as you can.

Once the 60 seconds are up your score is presented to you and you
can restart the game over again to try for a better score.
